## Important: What gpt-image-1 Can and Cannot Do

### Strengths
- **Concept art and illustrations**: Excellent at producing stylized images across
  many art styles (painterly, flat, watercolor, etc.)
- **Character design**: Strong at generating characters with specific details when
  prompted well
- **Transparent backgrounds**: Supported natively via `background: "transparent"`
  with PNG output

### Limitations
- **Pixel art is interpretive, not pixel-perfect**: The model generates 1024x1024
  images that *look like* pixel art but are not actual low-res pixel grids. For
  real game sprites, you may need to downscale and clean up output, or treat
  generated images as reference art.
- **Style consistency across generations**: Each generation is independent. Even
  with the same prompt, results will vary. Reuse exact style descriptions and
  specify colors by hex code to maximize consistency.
- **Seamless tiles**: The model can approximate tileable textures but they may not
  tile perfectly. Manual cleanup may be needed.
- **Transparent background bug**: When using `background: "transparent"`,
  gpt-image-1 sometimes removes white areas within the subject itself. See the
  "Transparent Background Best Practices" section in SKILL.md for workarounds.
- **No revised prompt**: gpt-image-1 does NOT return a `revised_prompt` via the
  `/v1/images/generations` endpoint (unlike DALL-E 3). You cannot see how the
  model reinterpreted your prompt.
- **No image preview in CLI**: Claude Code cannot display images inline. The user
  must open generated files in an external viewer.

## Style Presets

These are starting-point suggestions. Adapt them to the specific request —
combine elements, adjust details, change palettes. Do not use them as rigid
templates.

### Pixel Art

> "Pixel art style, clean pixels, limited color palette, no anti-aliasing,
> [NxN] pixel canvas"

Variations:
- **Retro 8-bit**: "8-bit retro pixel art, NES-era color palette, 4-color limit per sprite"
- **16-bit**: "16-bit pixel art, SNES-era, richer color palette, subtle shading"
- **Modern pixel**: "Modern pixel art, detailed sub-pixel shading, vibrant colors"

### Flat Vector / UI

> "Clean flat vector illustration, solid colors, no gradients, sharp edges,
> minimal design, suitable for UI"

### Hand-Painted / Concept Art

> "Digital painting style, visible brush strokes, rich color blending,
> concept art quality, painterly lighting"

### Isometric

> "Isometric perspective, 2:1 ratio, clean edges, game-ready isometric tile,
> consistent light source from top-left"

### Low-Poly 3D

> "Low-poly 3D render, flat-shaded polygons, minimalist geometric style,
> soft studio lighting"

### Watercolor / Storybook

> "Watercolor illustration style, soft edges, paper texture, gentle color
> bleeding, storybook quality"

## Game-Specific Style Presets

### By Game Genre

**Platformer (2D side-scroller)**
> "2D side-view perspective, vibrant colors, clear silhouette, readable at
> small size, platform-game style"

**Top-Down RPG**
> "Top-down perspective, 45-degree overhead view, RPG style, detailed but
> clean, readable at tile size"

**Card Game**
> "Card illustration style, portrait framing with border space, rich detail
> in center, painterly quality"

**Visual Novel**
> "Anime/manga illustration style, character portrait, expressive features,
> clean line art, soft cel shading"

**Mobile/Casual**
> "Bright cheerful style, rounded shapes, thick outlines, high contrast,
> mobile-friendly clarity"

### Tactics / SRPG Sub-Styles

**FFT / Yoshida Style** (Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre)
> "Isometric tactical RPG, chibi pixel art sprites with 1:2 head-to-body
> ratio, muted earth-tone palette — aged parchment beiges, warm ambers,
> olive greens, dusty browns, slate blues. Dark grey outlines (#282828),
> medieval manuscript aesthetic, pencil hatching with warm watercolor tones,
> diamond tile grid, diorama quality"

**Tactics Ogre / Dark Tactics** (grittier variant)
> "Dark medieval isometric tactical RPG, pixel art with semi-realistic
> proportions, somber muted palette — dark browns, deep purples, charcoal
> greys, blood reds, cold blues. Political war drama aesthetic, limited
> color index, gritty fantasy, pencil etching with CG coloring"

**Shining Force / Classic 16-bit SRPG**
> "16-bit Genesis SRPG style, bright saturated pixel art, angled 3/4
> top-down view, vivid colorful palette, heroic adventure aesthetic,
> anime-influenced character design, tile-based terrain, clean readable
> sprites with bold outlines"

**Fire Emblem GBA**
> "GBA pixel art tactical RPG, top-down grid view, 16-color sprite
> palette, clean readable faction-colored units (blue player, red enemy),
> dark grey outlines (#282828), anime character portraits, snappy
> proportions, strategic clarity"

**Disgaea / Anime Tactics**
> "Anime chibi SRPG, extreme super-deformed proportions with oversized
> heads, vivid saturated high-contrast neon colors, 2D hand-drawn sprites
> on isometric terrain, exaggerated anime eyes and hair, comedic fantasy
> aesthetic, bright and energetic"

**HD-2D / Modern Tactics** (Triangle Strategy, Octopath Traveler)
> "HD-2D style, pixel art sprites in 3D environment, tilt-shift diorama
> effect with depth-of-field bokeh blur, volumetric lighting, SNES-inspired
> pixel characters on detailed terrain, dynamic shadows, warm atmospheric
> lighting, retro-modern hybrid, miniature diorama aesthetic"

### Palette Suggestions by Theme

| Theme | Palette Description |
|-------|-------------------|
| Fantasy Forest | Deep greens, warm golds, mossy browns, dappled sunlight |
| Dungeon/Dark | Cool grays, deep purples, torch-orange highlights, dark atmosphere |
| Ocean/Water | Teals, deep blues, seafoam white, coral accents |
| Desert/Arid | Sandy yellows, terracotta, burnt orange, pale blue sky |
| Cyberpunk | Neon pink, electric blue, dark chrome, purple haze |
| Cozy/Wholesome | Warm pastels, soft pinks, cream, light wood tones |
| Horror | Desaturated greens, blood red accents, deep shadows, fog gray |

## Cost Estimates

Costs are approximate and subject to change. Check
[OpenAI pricing](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for current rates.

## History File Schema (.imagegen-history.jsonl)

Append-only JSONL. Each line is a self-contained JSON object:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "assets/sprites/robot-idle-v2",   // Auto-derived from output path
  "timestamp": "2026-03-15T14:32:07Z",    // ISO 8601 UTC
  "prompt": "Pixel art style...",          // Exact prompt sent to API
  "output": "assets/sprites/robot-idle-v2.png", // Relative to project root
  "params": { "size": "1024x1024", "quality": "medium", "background": "transparent", "model": "gpt-image-1" },
  "parentId": "assets/sprites/robot-idle", // null for first-of-concept
  "bytes": 231044,
  "outputFormat": "png"                    // Image encoding format
}
```

The file is **append-only** — entries are never modified in place. It is also
**disposable** — if deleted, the skill still works. Claude falls back to
conversation context for iteration.

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Iterate at low quality first.** Use `--quality low` to explore concepts
   quickly (~$0.01/image), then upgrade to `medium` or `high` for the keeper.

2. **Be explicit about what you do NOT want.** "No text", "no watermark",
   "no background elements", "no gradient".

3. **Reference real art styles.** "In the style of Studio Ghibli backgrounds"
   or "Celeste-inspired pixel art" gives the model strong anchors.

4. **For tilesets, generate one tile at a time.** Requesting a full grid in a
   single image produces inconsistent results.

5. **Transparent backgrounds work best with PNG.** Always use `--background
   transparent` and a `.png` output path together. Include the anti-leak
   prompt language described in SKILL.md.

6. **Square (1024x1024) is most versatile.** Use rectangular only when the
   content clearly benefits (landscapes, tall characters).

7. **Specify colors by hex code for consistency.** "Using colors #3A7D44,
   #F2C94C, #EB5757" produces more consistent results across generations than
   "green, yellow, and red".
